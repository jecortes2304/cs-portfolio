      "description": "I am a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience in Android mobile development, cross-platform desktop application development, and Full Stack web development. I enjoy studying independently and learning new ways of doing things, new challenges that always allow me to put into practice any knowledge I have acquired or am learning. I have developed software mostly with Java in various environments, although I have used other languages and frameworks such as Javascript and ReactJs/NextJs/ExpressJs, Kotlin and Java for Android, Python and FastApi, among others. I don't professionally develop games, but I greatly enjoy learning C# and Unity as a hobby. I believe that technologies are truly negotiable, that we should use them conveniently to solve our tasks in the most efficient way, it's not necessary to learn them all, nor just one that works like a Swiss army knife, we should learn what is required for the project depending on its functional requirements."
